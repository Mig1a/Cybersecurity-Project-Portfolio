Vulnerability Assessment

Overview: Scanned a network of 20+ virtual machines to identify and report on vulnerabilities.

Key Tasks:

Used Nmap and Nikto for enumeration

Identified missing headers, outdated Apache versions, and public exploits

Delivered remediation steps (patching, hardening, config fixes)

Tools Used: Nmap, Nikto

Steps:

I launched a Kali VM and scanned the subnet using nmap -sS -sV.

I identified 20+ live hosts and detected open services.

I used Nikto to scan web servers for misconfigurations and vulnerable versions.

I recorded issues like missing X-Frame headers, CVEs, and Apache misconfigs.

I suggested remediation steps including patching and disabling directory indexing.
