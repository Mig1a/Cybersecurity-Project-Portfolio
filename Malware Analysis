Malware Analysis

Overview: Conducted static analysis on malware samples to identify behavior and classify threat types.

Key Tasks:

Retrieved sample hashes and checked reputation with VirusTotal

Identified malware families (PlugX, Optix)

Documented file traits, behavior, and analysis output

Tools Used: VirusTotal, Windows, static analysis tools

Steps:

I collected unknown .exe files and performed static inspection (file size, timestamps, PE headers).

I generated MD5/SHA1 hashes and submitted them to VirusTotal.

I recorded classification results (e.g., backdoor, RAT).

I noted signatures, family associations, and AV detection rates.

I documented findings for reporting and potential escalation.
