Network Intrusion Detection with Snort

Overview: Deployed a signature-based NIDS using Snort and Docker to monitor for ICMP and HTTPS-based threats.

Key Tasks:

Installed and configured Snort on VM

Wrote custom rules to detect ping and HTTPS traffic

Validated alerts by simulating attacker traffic with Dockerized Pytbull

Tools Used: Snort, Pytbull-ng, Docker, Vim

Steps:

I installed Docker and pulled pytbull-ng containers.

I launched victim and attacker containers to simulate malicious traffic.

I installed Snort and configured the network interface.

I created custom rules in local.rules (e.g., ICMP detection).

I validated the configuration using snort -c and started detection mode.

I simulated HTTPS pings to google.com and observed Snort alerts in real time.
