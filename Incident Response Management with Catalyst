Incident Response Management with Catalyst

Overview: Simulated full incident response workflows for phishing, malware, and brute-force attacks using Catalyst IR platform.

Key Tasks:

Created and managed incidents for different attack types

Tracked observables (IPs, hashes) and analyzed IoCs via VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB

Assigned tasks, added notes, and documented lessons learned

Tools Used: Catalyst, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB

Steps:

I installed Catalyst using the setup script and verified it was running at https://catalyst.localhost.

I logged in with default admin credentials and created new incidents using the phishing, malware, and brute-force templates.

I added observables (e.g., malicious IPs, hashes) to each case and marked their type.

I cross-referenced observables on VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB, then added notes and risk ratings in Catalyst.

I updated status fields, resolved tasks, and closed each incident.

I documented lessons learned and classified each case as True Positive, False Positive, etc.
