# Cybersecurity-Project-Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of hands-on cybersecurity labs that I completed as part of my academic training. The labs cover core defensive security practices including threat intelligence analysis, incident response, intrusion detection, malware analysis, vulnerability scanning, and digital forensics.

Each lab is documented with step-by-step notes, commands, and tool usage to demonstrate applied cybersecurity skills using industry-standard tools such as Splunk, Snort, mitmproxy, Wireshark, Nmap, Autopsy, and more.
